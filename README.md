Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to visualize campaign outcomes.
## Overview of Project
Comparing different campaigns outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
To visualize the outcome on how fast certain campaigns in subcategory theater and plays reach their funding goals in relation to their lauch date.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There was more successful campaigns in May, which was also the time of the most failed. In October there was zero canceled campaigns and more in the month of January. Overall, the grand total was 1369 outcomes.![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101304672/159417568-c02d07ba-8fc9-46e6-b60e-159662c7db6e.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Out of 534 total projects who goal was between $1000 to $4999 and also the goal with the most projects 73% was successful. Only one goal had a 100% failed outcome which was $45000 to $49999 range. I also did notice the goal $15000 to $19999 had the 50% failed and successful out of 24 project. There was no goals that canceled but more higher failed percentages overall.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge I faced was trying to figure out how to successfully apply the countifs formula, After some research I was able to apply the formula and get the information I needed. I had to change the formula for each column and row for accurate numbers.
## Results
My two conclusions about the Outcomes based on Launch Date would be that the month of December had almost the same outcome for successful and failed launch dates. Overall, there was more successful outcomes total but almost more than half had failed in a year time frame. The importance is most campaigns did meet their launch dates.
My conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals are accourding to the chart more goals had a higher percentage cancelled than successful and both had no canceled at all, so most goals was not being met during the expected time frame.
A limitation in this data set would be that in Outcomes Based on Goals no goals was canceled so it could not reflect on the chart to visualize. 
Another graph that could have been used to help the visualization, I would of suggested a bar graph.
